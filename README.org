* Description

The `Real Time Stock Simulator` is a tool to help test and develop another tool
I am working on. I wanted something that would reliably create fake stock market
data to test the other (nameless) tool I am working on. For now, my needs are
fairly basic. I need it to create a 'log' for every interval (1 minute, 5
minutes, 15 minutes) for possibly hundreds of fake stocks and log the quotes to
a database. I also need it to create backlogs of data; for example, if you want
to generate data for two months prior it will generate the data for the
specified intervals. In addition to backlogging data on command, as I will not
have this tool running on a server 24/7 when I am doing local testing I need it
to fill any gaps in data. If I start the application and don't use it for a
month I need it to detect the missing data in the database and generate all the
missing data until the current datetime. Those are my needs at the moment, they
may change later.

I am creating this as a library as I am not sure if I will ultimately use it via
a web interface, or continue to use it as a CLI/TUI application.

I will only be testing with postgreSQL, unless my needs change in the future.

Due to the resource heavy nature of creating quotes for possibly hundreds of stock symbols for
an arbitrary period of time (possibly with a frequency of 1 minute), I have
chosen to use Rust for this project - and because I like using it :). I will
eventually make this application concurrent, to reduce the time needed to create
those backlogs. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

I will accept PRs if they are in line with what I want the application to do.
Feel free to reach out if you have any ideas, or if something is not idiomatic
(Rust is a relatively new language for me!).

* Prerequisites
This depends on Postgres. This can be changed by changing the `features` line
for the Diesel dependency, however be sure to ensure all SQL is compatible with
your target database. I have only testing with postgreSQL - use at your own risk.

* Features

+ Create Stock Symbols.
+ Generate past data for Stocks.
+ Populate data at interval specified with data for all stocks created.
+ Fill in any gaps if/when configuration is changed.
+ On startup, ensure no gaps exist in stock data.
+ Concurrently generate data.

* Configuration
To get started, install the diesel-cli, create the database, and run the migrations. Copy the
`env.example` as `.env` and set the `DATABASE_URL`.

* Troubleshooting
(empty)

* To Do [2/8]
- [X] Add dependency for database
- [X] Add dependency for env files
- [ ] Read env file
- [ ] Connect to database
- [ ] Read config file
- [ ] Ability to create Stock symbols
- [ ] Detect gaps in data
- [ ] Detect difference in config and existing data
- [ ] Concurrently generate data
